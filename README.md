I developed this project as part of the hackclub event organized by highseas, which took approximately 20 hours to complete. I hope you find it interesting.

<hr>
# Mic transmiter
Use any device as a microphone.
<hr>

## receiver.py
Run this script where the input audio will be transmitted.

## mic.py
Run this script in the device you want to use as a microphone. It will transmit the input audio to the specified LAN IP(the ip printed after running receiver.py on the target device).
<hr>
You have to run receiver.py first. Then run transmitter.py after that. Otherwise it will cause an error.

I used my PC as the microphone and phone as the receiver, my phone plays the microphone audio without any kind of lags.
